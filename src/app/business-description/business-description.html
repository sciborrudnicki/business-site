      <!-- Long description -->
    <div class="text-surface-600 leading-relaxed">
      As an experienced Angular trainer, I specialize in guiding developers of all levels—from beginners taking their first steps into the world of component-based architecture to seasoned professionals optimizing complex enterprise applications.
      My training programs are designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, ensuring you not only understand Angular's core concepts like components, services, and reactive programming with RxJS, but also how to apply them in real-world scenarios.
      Whether you're building scalable web apps, integrating state management with NgRx, or mastering testing strategies with Jasmine and Karma, my sessions focus on hands-on learning, code reviews, and personalized feedback.
      <!-- I offer flexible formats including one-on-one coaching for intensive skill-building, group workshops for team collaboration, and consulting services to refactor existing codebases. Drawing from years of industry experience, I help you create high-performance, maintainable Angular applications that stand the test of time and user expectations. -->
